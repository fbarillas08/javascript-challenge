# javascript-challenge
There are two solutions to this challenge

Basic_Project uses only the datetime field to sort out the sightings dataset.

I made modifications to the html code to change the input method from a text box to a dropdown menu with
the only available dates in the dataset.



MultCriteria_Project uses a more advanced selection methodology allowing me to filter the dataset based on any of the fields available including a wild card for the comments sections.


Both projects include modifications to css stylesheets and javaScript files.
